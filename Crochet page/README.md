# Session-1-HTML-Page

Session 1 Basic Homework Task.

## Assignment

Style the first page of the HTML homework solution code from last week

### Extended Assignment

Create the second page so it contains the following elements, and link the two pages together

1. `<video>...</video> or <iframe>`
2. `<table>...</table>`

## What I would change or add:
1. Add things for accessibility like alt text for an image
2. Layout my CSS better from the beginning. The entire page needs to be in a div that setthe size to 80% instead it becoming the sizing mess it is. 
3. I would make the card a link as well for easier clicking / going to the link. People are quite used to being able to click on the whole card or image and be able to go into the page or link it displays. 

## My biggest learnings
1. How important it is to set out your div's properly and make sure things are accurately named. 
2. Flex box
3. Sometimes you just need to walk away and come back. Tears in the shower are great for brainstorming issues like why your footer size is off by 3%. 
4. How important specificity is when it comes to CSS and the shenanigans of 
```
.class element,element,element {
 
} 

vs 

.class element
.class element {

}
```
