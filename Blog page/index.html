        <h1>From Lesson Plans to Lines of Code: <br>
            Sarah's Journey to Software Development
        </h1>

        <p>
            Teaching. It was a dream Sarah nurtured since childhood. The thrill of igniting young minds, the
            satisfaction of seeing them blossom, it all seemed perfect. But after a few years in the classroom, a
            nagging feeling wouldn't go away. Something was missing. Then, during an internship, she stumbled upon
            graphic design. The possibilities of visual storytelling, the power to evoke emotions with a single image,
            it sparked a fire within her.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, life rarely follows a straight path. Neither teaching nor graphic design panned out as Sarah
            envisioned. A move to the Netherlands, a land of windmills and tulips, brought a new set of challenges. Her
            teaching degree became useless without fluency in Dutch. Graphic design jobs demanded video editing
            expertise and a portfolio that screamed "pro", both things Sarah lacked. Discouraged but not defeated, she
            took a customer service and order management role. It paid the bills, but the creative spark remained dim.
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening, as Sarah watched her husband, a senior software engineer, engrossed in a coding project, a
            question flickered in her mind. The way he navigated complex problems, the satisfaction he derived from
            building something from scratch, it resonated with a deep part of her. Could this be the answer she'd been
            searching for?
        </p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The unknown territory of coding wasn't exactly a walk in the park. There were nights of frustration, lines
            of code that looked like gibberish, and moments of feeling utterly lost. But then, a breakthrough! A program
            compiled successfully, a function worked as intended. The satisfaction was unlike anything Sarah had
            experienced before.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is Sarah's story, and it's far from over. She's trading lesson plans for lines of code, transforming
            classrooms into the digital world. Her journey might seem unconventional, but it's a testament to the human
            spirit's ability to adapt and thrive. Here's the key takeaway: it's never too late to chase a new dream,
            especially if it ignites your passion and challenges you to grow.
